To get started with the database,
1. Install mongodb and MongoDB compass for easy visualization of the database.
2. Create a database called 'Customers' and 2 collections : 'users' and 'cars'.
3. Copy the data in "CarData.json" into the 'cars' collection as it is this data that gets fetched and displayed on the webpage.
4. The 'users' collection stores the data entered by the user.
5. Once the above mentioned steps have been completed, run 'npm install' to install the dependencies and 'node server.js' to start the server.
